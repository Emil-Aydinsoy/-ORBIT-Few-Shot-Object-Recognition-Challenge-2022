# -ORBIT-Few-Shot-Object-Recognition-Challenge-2022
The ORBIT Few-Shot Object Recognition Challenge 2022 ("Challenge") is hosted by Microsoft and aims to drive research in few-shot object recognition on real-world data. The Challenge is based on the Teachable Object Recognition benchmark on the ORBIT dataset (Massiceti et al., ICCV 2021). Here, a user can 'teach' an object recognizer their personal objects by providing it just a few short training videos of each object. Once the model has learned that user's objects, it is then tested on how often it can recognize that user's objects in real-world cluttered videos.
